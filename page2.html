                   <p>Name: 2022 BUGATTI CHIRON SUPER SPORT</p>
                   <p>Price: R48 073 200
                   <P>The 2022 Chiron isn't only the ultimate Bugatti, it's the ultimate car. Period. This $3 million work of art is capable of pummeling the pavement at over 200 mph thanks to a 16-cylinder engine that features four turbochargers and cranks out at least 1500 horsepower—the more expensive Super Sport model is even more powerful. </P>
                   <p> The Chiron's cabin is just as artfully designed as its exterior, and it coddles occupants in fine materials that help justify its price tag. But let's be honest, people are really paying for the performance here. Those looking for modern conveniences (think Apple CarPlay) or driver-assistance tech, they won't find them here, but after driving this monster, they likely won't care about such minor drawbacks.</p>

                <p>Name: 2022 PORSCHE CAYENNE TURBO GT</p>
                <p>Price: R2 920 000</p>
                
                <P>The 2022 Porsche Cayenne GT's 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 takes center stage with its 631 horsepower and 626 lb-ft of torque. While these numbers don't match the Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid's, make no mistake: the Turbo GT is Porsche's most performance-oriented SUV. In this case, Porsche's much-lauded GT team did not help with the car's development, but the Turbo GT proves its point all the same.</P>
                <p>Besides the powerful engine, Porsche gave the SUV several enhancements to make it drive even more like a sports car. The air suspension is 15 percent stiffer compared to the Cayenne Turbo, with the system adjusted to handle the extra power. The power-steering setup and rear-axle steering are also retuned, and Porsche engineers said they were overall able to reduce body roll and increase the car's precision in corners. The Cayenne Turbo GT's 22-inch Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires were developed for the Turbo GT, and its carbon-ceramic brakes, distinguished by their yellow calipers, measure a massive 17.3-inches in the front and 16.1 inches back. The Cayenne Turbo GT is also 0.7-inch lower than the Cayenne Turbo Coupe, and its all-wheel-drive system includes a water-cooled transfer case to support the model's ultra-high performance.</p>

                <p>Name:2021 VW GOLF 8 GTI</p>
                <p>Price:R669 300</p>
                <P> The Volkswagen Golf 8 GTI is powered by an uprated version of the familiar EA888 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine. The tinkering has given it an extra 11kW and 20Nm, bringing the grand total to 180kW and 370Nm.And yes, rivals like the Hyundai i30 N are technically more powerful, but somehow the Golf GTI feels faster than the numbers suggest.</P>
                <p>Sure, we’re not speaking of heart-stopping acceleration here; but the Golf GTI satisfies with its ultra-responsive throttle and brisk, effortless acceleration (it takes just 6.4 seconds to get to 100km/h, according to factory claims). It's perfectly calibrated seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox is instrumental here, and it works like a charm when left to its own devices. </p>

                <P>Price:R3 300 000</P>
                <P>Visually, you’ll be able to spot the newcomer with its revised design. There’s a new front end, complete with redesigned headlights featuring LED technology, like the lightbar that stretches inwards from the lights to the badge. The rear light cluster gets a completely new look too making the facelift easy to spot. Customers will have the choice of 8 exterior colours including 3 new ones (Ascot Grey, Vibrant Violet and Smoky Grey).</P>
                <p>Inside, the Volkswagen Polo’s cabin has been given a makeover, with the redesigned multifunction steering wheel, updated infotainment system and wireless App-Connect (which is available as an option). There’s now touch functionality on the higher spec models that replace buttons and knobs.</p>
